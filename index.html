<h1>Installing Mods to Minecraft Using Forge</h1>
<h4>Downloading Forge</h4>
In order to instsall mods to Minecraft you have to have a program that will contain all the mod files in the correct location. For this we will use forge.
<ul>
  <li>Go to the Forge website.</li>
  <li>Download the version of forge for the version of Minecraft you want to play on.</li>
  <li>Once it is downloaded open the Minecraft launcher, there should be a new installation of Minecraft titled "Forge" followed by whatever version you're using.</li>
